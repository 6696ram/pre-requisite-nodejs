## What is JavaScript?

JavaScript was initially created to **"make webpages alive"**.

The programs in this language are called scripts. They can be written right in the HTML and execute automatically as the page 
loads.
Scripts are provided and executed as a plain text. They don't need a special preparation or a compilation to run.
In this aspect, JavaScript is very different from another language called Java.

> When JavaScript was created, it initially had another name: "LiveScript". But Java language was very popular at that time, 
> so it was decided that positioning a new language with a similar name of Java would help.
> As it evolved, JavaScript became a fully independent language, with its own specification called [ECMAScript](https://github.com/shravankb/ECMAScript-Specifications), 
> and it has no relation to Java at all.
